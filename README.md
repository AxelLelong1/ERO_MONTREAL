# Libs needed :
- OSMNX
- MATPLOTLIB
- SCIKIT-LEARN

Make sure you have these python libraries installed before doing anything.

# Adding maps
If you need other maps than Montreal's, simply change the location in the `Drone/calculate.py`
This might take a while because of the calculations done to the graph afterwards.

# Running the simulation
To run the simulation, simply open a terminal at the root of the project, and run `python3 main.py`

Choose the location and the simulation will run...
Might take a while when optimizing the graph...
